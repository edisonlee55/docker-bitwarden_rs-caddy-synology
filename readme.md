# Docker Vaultwarden proxified for Synology NAS

A docker-compose ready package to run [Vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden) proxified with [Caddy server](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy-docker). This setup provides a Vaultwarden server with support of websocket notifications.
 
The goal is to keep the Synology NAS system untouched to be upgrade-proof. This is the reason why caddy server is used to enable the websocket notifications. Synology do not allow advanced setting of their Nginx reverse proxy and ports 80/443 are not free. We will use the embedded reverse proxy and forward the request on some other ports. This is the reason why Vaultwarden server is not set to use SSL because behind 2 proxies.

Despite this has been made to run on Synology NAS, this should run on other systems with / without minor adaptations.

## Documentation

- [Vaultwarden wiki](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki)
- [Caddy server 2.0 docs](https://caddyserver.com/docs/)

## Pre-requisite

- A Docker compatible Synology NAS
- An up and running Docker package
- A SSH client
- A domain name with Let's Encrypt certs enabled. This part is off-topic here.

### Conventions
As convention, we will use as example the following
- The domain : `bw.yourdomain.com`
- Folder used : `/volumeX/docker/` to be personnalized to your DSM setup

## Installation

1. Download this repo
2. Unzip and review `docker-compose_bitwarden-caddy.yml` settings
3. Copy this repo content to `/volumeX/docker/`

## Setup

You will first need to access the admin page to fine tune the Vaultwarden server. Beware, if accessed once, it will be enabled in `/data/config.json` whatever are the Environment variables. You'll need to disable the admin panel from itself.

1. On Synology's DSM GUI
	1. Go to `Settings` > `Application Portal` > `Reverse proxy`
	2. Add a new entry for `HTTPS`
		- Name : Bitwarden entry point
		- Source protocol : `HTTPS`
		- source domain : `bw.yourdomain.com`
		- port : `443`
		- check `HSTS` and `HTTP/2`
		- destination protocol : `HTTP`
		- destination host: `localhost`
		- port : `8080`
		- In _Custom Headers_ tab, click the drop down list next to _add_ button and choose `websockets`
	3. Add a new entry for `HTTP` 
		- Make sure webstation is running with a dummy page to be served. This is only as fallback.
		- Name : Bitwarden entry point HTTP
		- Source protocol : `HTTP`
		- source domain : `bw.yourdomain.com`
		- port : `80`
		- destination protocol : `HTTP`
		- destination host: `localhost`
		- port : `80`
2. Using a terminal, connect through SSH
	1. Connect your admin account with password
	2. Gain root using `sudo -i` with your admin password
	3. `cd /volumeX/docker/`
	4. Pull needed images `docker-compose -f docker-compose_bitwarden-caddy.yml pull`
	5. Ready for a first run : `docker-compose -f docker-compose_bitwarden-caddy.yml up`

If everything goes well, the prompt will let you know the containers are started and wait until a `ctrl + C` is triggered to stop them. Test the accesses and start the Birwarden_RS fine tune at `https://bw.yourdomain.com/admin`. Once finished disable the access to admin panel from itself. 

Do not forget to [install the clients](https://bitwarden.com/#download) for desktops, browers and mobile. Test their connection.

Shutdown the servers issuing a `ctrl + C` in the terminal

## Startup and Maintenance

### Startup
Once setup is finished, you're ready to launche your "_production_" server. Review all the settings and  environment varaibles in the `.yml` file. Test it using the same `docker-compose -f docker-compose_bitwarden-caddy.yml up` as previously. If anything goes well, stop them and run as `detached` with the following command.

	`docker-compose -f docker-compose_bitwarden-caddy.yml up -d`

### Maintenance
Upgrade on a regular basis the servers as packages continue to evolve on a daily/weekly basis. From time to time, Run from a terminal the following commands as `root`.

````sh
cd /volumeX/docker/
docker-compose -f docker-compose_bitwarden-caddy.yml down
docker-compose -f docker-compose_bitwarden-caddy.yml pull
docker-compose -f docker-compose_bitwarden-caddy.yml up -d
````

## Hardening

Your Vaultwarden instance is now up and running. It is not yet hardened to brute-force attacks. Please, install Fail2ban to avoid loosing your account control. Here a way to run [Fail2Ban](https://github.com/sosandroid/docker-fail2ban-synology) in Docker on Synology NAS

## To do

Modifying `Caddyfile` to filter ip addresses allowed to access `/admin`. Does not work yet on Caddy V2.0 beta20. `ipfilter` directive not supported
